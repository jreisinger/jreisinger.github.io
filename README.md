The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure
thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion
of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish
and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures. (As we
shall see later, this very tractability has its own problems.)

Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that
it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct
itself. It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms. The
magic of myths and legends has come true in our time. One types the correct
incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things
that never were nor could be.

-- Frederick P. Brooks, Mythical Man-Month
