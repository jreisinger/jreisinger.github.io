ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my homepage, friend. I mess around with computer infrastructure, security and programming. Among other things. I keep some of my [code](https://github.com/jreisinger) and [writings](https://jreisinger.blogspot.com) public.

> The worst enemy of security is complexity. -- [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/1999/11/a_plea_for_simplicit.html)

> You need a certain amount of complexity to do any particular job. -- [Larry Wall](https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/larry.html)

> The incomprehensible should cause suspicion rather than admiration. -- [Niklaus Wirth](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/Articles/LeanSoftware.pdf)
