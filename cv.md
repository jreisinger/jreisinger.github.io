Professional Summary
--------------------

I have 5+ year experience in systems administration. I have administered
infrastructures of varied sizes (10 to 500+ servers/devices) and types (testing
environments for auditors and developers, standard IT infrastructure of a
medium sized company, core infrastructure for a scientific institute). I have
written many small to medium sized scripts and couple of larger programs. My
preferred technologies are Linux (Debian) and Perl, although I try to practice
the "right tool for the job" philosophy. I also have some skills in the areas
of IT auditing, IT security and simple projects management. I am not bad at
communicating with technical and non-technical folks.
