Professional Summary
--------------------

I have been doing IT related stuff for companies of varied sizes in
telecommunication, utilities, software development and research industries. My
experience is mainly in system administration (5+ years) and IT auditing and
security (5+ years). I have touched several infrastructures and written quite a
few scripts/programs. My preferred technologies are Linux and Perl, although I
try to practice the "right tool for the job" philosophy. I am not bad at
managing smaller projects and communicating with technical and non-technical
folks.
