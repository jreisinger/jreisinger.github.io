Professional Summary
--------------------

I have been doing IT related stuff for companies of varied sizes and types for
10+ years. My experience is mainly in system administration and IT security. I
have touched several infrastructures and written quite a few scripts/programs.
I try to stay on top of new technologies and practices and use them when/where
appropriate. I am not bad at managing smaller projects and teams. I can
communicate well with technical and non-technical folks.
