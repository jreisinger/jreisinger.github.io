I am interested, among other things, in how computer systems work and how to
use and manage them effectively. To be a bit more specific, I dabble in system
administration, security and programming. Some of my preferred IT tools are
GNU/Linux and [Perl](https://www.perl.org), although I try to practice the
"[right tool for the
job](http://catb.org/esr/writings/unix-koans/shell-tools.html)" philosophy.
