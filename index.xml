      <description>I am interested, among other things, in universal machines for information storage and manipulation :-). I like to find out how computer systems work and how to use and manage them effectively. To be a bit more specific, I dabble in system administration (operations), security and programming. Some of the IT tools I fancy are GNU/Linux and BashPerlPython. I try to practice the &amp;ldquo;right tool for the job&amp;rdquo; philosophy. I monkey with new technologies and languages from time to time.</description>

I have been doing IT related stuff for companies of varied sizes and types for 10+ years. My experience is mainly in systems administration and IT security. I have touched several infrastructures and written quite a few scripts/programs. I try to stay on top of new technologies and practices and use them when/where appropriate. I am not bad at managing smaller projects and teams.</description>
