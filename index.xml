      <description>I am interested in universal machines that manipulate information under the control of a changeable program. How do they work (especially the changeable programs) and how to make them useful. I dabble in the fields of systems administration (SRE, DevOps) and programming. Among other things. Buy me stuff if you want to make me happy :-). I take photos from time to time.</description>

      <description>I have been doing IT stuff for companies of varied sizes and types for 10+ years. My experience is mainly in systems administration (SRE) and IT security. I have touched several infrastructures and done quite some programming or scripting. I try to stay on top of new technologies and practices and use them when/where appropriate. I am not bad at managing smaller projects and teams.
 There is a huge difference between having ten years of experience and having one year of experience repeated ten times.</description>
